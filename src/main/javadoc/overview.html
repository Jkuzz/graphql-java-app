    This application provides a <a href="https://www.graphql-java.com/">GraphQL-java</a> endpoint for the Czech Republic
    region, district and town population data. The core database is contained in the .provider package, while the
    .ui and .cmd serve as user entry points. The provider can, however, be used independently in any context.
</p>
<p>
    The provider requires the source csv data to be present in the 'resources' folder accessed by the ClassLoader.
